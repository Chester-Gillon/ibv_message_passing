 * @details A variant of the https://github.com/chester-gillon/switch_test but which uses a RDMA IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET to
 *          transmit and receive the frames, rather than PCAP.
 *
 * @todo Is there an equivalent of pcap_statistics to collect in the event of missing frames for debugging if
 *       frames were dropped on receipt?
