/**
 * @brief Register the definition of all communication paths between the controller and workers
 * @param[in] controller_and_workers_on_seperate_pcs
 *              Determines how the Infiniband ports are configured for the communication paths:
 *              a. When false the controller and workers are on the same PC with an external loopback from Infiniband
 *                 port 1 to 2.
 *              b. When true the controller is one one PC and the workers are on a different PC, and both ports are used.
 *                 There are is a connection from:
 *                 - Controller PC Infiniband port 1 to worker PC Infiniband port 1
 *                 - Controller PC Infiniband port 2 to worker PC Infiniband port 2
