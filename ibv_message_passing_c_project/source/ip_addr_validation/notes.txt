0. Introduction
===============

Looks at alternatives to regex to validate IPV4 numeric address with optional prefix for:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1530594/how-to-check-allowed-characters-in-bash-with-regex


1. getaddrinfo()
================

This uses is_ipv4.c which calls getaddrinfo() with options to only accept numeric IPv4 addresses.

Accepts an IPv4 without prefix:
$ ./is_ipv4 127.0.0.1
yes, 127.0.0.1 is allowed

Rejcts an IPv4 without prefix:
$ ./is_ipv4 ::1/128
<<no output>>

But rejects an IPv4 with prefix:
$ ./is_ipv4 127.0.0.1/24
<<no output>>


2. ipcalc in AlmaLinux 8.10
===========================

AlmaLinux 8.10 has ipcalc-0.2.4-4.el8 from https://gitlab.com/ipcalc/ipcalc

Using the -c option to validate the IP address, and -4 to specific IPv4 this accepts the IPv4 IP address with a valid prefix:
$ ipcalc -c -4 127.0.0.1/24
<<no output>>

Rejects the IPv4 IP address with an invalid prefix:
$ ipcalc -c -4 127.0.0.1#24
ipcalc: bad IPv4 address: 127.0.0.1#24

And rejects the IPv6 IP address:
$ ipcalc -c -4 ::1/128
ipcalc: bad IPv4 prefix: 128

Which matches the behaviour requested in the ask Ubuntu question


3. ipcalc in Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS is different
============================================

On a Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS system installed the ipcalc package:

However, the ipcalc under Ubuntu has different options to the same program under AlmaLinux and doesn't support validating
IP addresses.
